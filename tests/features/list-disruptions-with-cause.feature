    Scenario: create disruption with cause
        Given I have the following clients in my database:

        Given I have the following causes in my database:

        I fill in header "X-Customer-Id" with "5"

        I fill in header "Authorization" with "e74598a0-239b-4d9f-92e3-18cfc120672b"

        When I post to "/disruptions" with:
